          We serve as support of shetlers which help of providing protection,
          care to animals in need; a full-service animal adoption center. Animal
          shelters and rescues are amazing! Usually with limited resources and
          very little publicity, they help untold numbers of animals which did
          not have luck for happy life. Give back by choosing one or more of the
          following ways to show your appreciation for the groups that do so
          much for animals, people and your community.
