  "faq": {
    "title": "faq",
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "What is SafePets Token?",
        "answer": "SafePets token is a decentralized cryptocurrency based on the idea of saving pets and other species from extinction one transaction at a time. 2% of each transaction is donated to organizations in the fight to save endangered animals."
      },
      {
        "question": "What do you mean by \"decentralized\"?",
        "answer": "SafePets is designed so that no one, not the creator or other individuals, groups, or governments, can influence, counterfeit, or seize the cryptocurrency account. There is no central point. Technically speaking, it operates according to rules agreed by consensus, rather than decided upon by some foundation or entity."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does SafePets token have a future?",
        "answer": "We have a team of professionals that are the best at what they do in the industry. With each passing day the endangerment of animals worsens, so we will be the sun to their moon, and we think everyone will want to be a part of that. Our future looks very BRIGHT!"
      },
      {
        "question": "What do you mean by \"cryptocurrency\"?",
        "answer": "Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is secured by cryptography, in contrast to conventional (fiat) currencies where they are secured by a government or governments. It's money for the people, and the more people own and use it, the more useful and valuable it becomes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Okay, but what does that mean?",
        "answer": "Think supply and demand. Only so much supply no matter the demand, the more demand the more valuable it is. Which means you don't have to trust any central organization or person like you would a bank. You are the bank, you’re in control."
      },
      {
        "question": "Who run’s SafePets token?",
        "answer": "No-one, or everyone does equally, depending how you look at it. The developers can release new software, but at the end of the day the community must choose to use that software. Remember the community includes not only the end-users, but miners, exchanges, payment processors, etc. We’re all in it for the same reason’s and if every ones in it to win it then it’s a recipe for success."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where can I buy SafePets token?",
        "answer": "The first exchange that you will be able to purchase and use the token on will be on pancakeswap.finance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my investment in SafePets safe?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. All our teams follow strict KYC policies. We will also be doing audits to make sure that nothing slips through the cracks, which can be found in our road map, phases 1 and 7."
